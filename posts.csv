225956433,1985581965,"The industry already has ""laboratory grade"" manufacturer data. Why Tracebook's ""lesse",682517670,"As published - Monday May 18 2021

Most manufacturers have dedicated facilities (such as anechoic chambers) in which their products are measured. While this approach produces—very ""clean""—high quality performance data, it makes it challenging for common users to verify loudspeaker performance in the field.

Furthermore, since there are many different ways to measure loudspeakers and display the data, there exists some ambiguity when comparing data from one manufacturer with that of another.

Tracebook—unambiguously—neither aspires nor pretends to facilitate ""laboratory grade"" data. Instead, it promotes complementary actionable reference field data, i.e.—data (within reasonable uncertainty) capable of being acted on—supplied by the community through multiple independent measurements and supported by a majority vote.



Previous Version - Monday May 17 2021

Part of our industry is based on a marketing‑driven economy where the kind of data—and how it is represented—affect sales. Some manufacturers may decide to publish, e.g., (over)simplified, incomplete, incomparable, or beautified data. As a result, manufacturer interests may lead to data which differs from field measurements that in turn cannot be validated.

Tracebook—unambiguously—neither pretends nor intends to facilitate ""laboratory grade"" data.

Should SubAligner offer an alternative method to measure the distance from FOH to the main array?

1. Measure its height.
2. Measure the distance to FOH. 
3. Look up the height of a single box on its spec sheet.
4. Enter the total number of boxes in the array

And SubAligner can estimate the distance from FOH to the middle of the array.

I hope everyone is having a nice holiday.

The beta invite process is going slow. In the last 5 days about 12 people have signed up. I can ask everyone to make 5 more invites, but I'm not sure if that will do it.

**Why am I pushing for 100?**

There are a very small number of people who have the time, resources, and motivation to make measurements based on our procedure and upload them to the site. These are our VIP early adopters. If we say that a conservative estimate is that 1% of all beta users will be one of these unicorns, then we need to invite at least 100 people to find 1 of these early adopters.

**How do we get there?**

My first impression is that we need to keep doing direct outreach to people who we think are most likely to be early adopters. This will increase our chances.

Maybe we give that a try for another week? And then what? Something bigger? Maybe we start inviting 10 or 20 people at a time until we get to at least 100?

**Why am I in a hurry?**

My main concern right now is keeping your interest as our moderators and founding members. If Tracebook starts to generate activity, you are more likely to keep participating. If no one is using it, you'll loose interest.

So what do you think? **What have you been hearing from the people you've been inviting.**

- **Better file downloads.** After struggling through a few different location, all files for the Download Results pop-up will now live on Amazon S3. It's a better long term solution. If you discover any files that do not download, please let me know.
- **Improved accuracy and speed.** After consulting with a real mathematician I discovered that the results in subAligner could be improved and speed up. I'm happy to tell you more about that if you're interested, but the end result is that each alignment solution can be calculated in about 4 seconds instead of 20 seconds. I'm interested in this speed for a future time when subAligner might execute on server in real-time while you wait instead of being pre-calculated ahead of time. This would then allow you to upload your own measurements to run an alignment on them in the field.",0,,,2021-06-10T18:38:10+00,2021-06-10T18:38:10+00
552890377,1764308066,RCF HDL10-A Carpet vs Tile,1353114646,"I made an attempt to capture my RCF HDL10-A speakers for Tracebook (part of an installed system at my church, so can't take a unit down very often). My room is 120' x 100' so I have plenty of space to capture the data indoors, but the floor surface is carpet. When I captured other speakers in the past I was encouraged to use a reflective surface like a tile under the microphone to increase high frequency data quality. For reference I decided to try and both options, carpet and tile (4x floor tiles placed together to achieve the recommended 30x60 tile size). After reviewing both readings I am now more confused as to whether either is is the more accurate reading given they are so different (blue trace carpet, green trace tile). From 20Hz - 1k phase is within 30º, but at 2k it swings to 100º difference. Cohearence is pretty identical between the two, but there is a huge difference in phase and magnitude, at 12K there is a 12dB difference. System info as follows:

Speaker settings: RCF HDL10-A - Far, 4-6 cluster, High Curving On, Indoor (the current settings for my hang), Gain: Unity (12 o-clock)

Distance and delay: 2.45m - 16.15/16.27ms

Mic & Audio Interface: DBX RTA-M, UA Arrow (Gain: 42dB, Monitor Out -8, SMAART out: -10dB)

If you have feature requests, post them here.

# Done!

- Pages: Index, Measurement, Upload, Profile, Profile Settings, Email Confirmation, Admin
- Decode WAV file on front end for HighCharts
- New user single sign on for forum
- Open current measurement in SubAligner
- Referral system
- Draft version of measurement procedure
- Invite first round of beta users
- Calculate system latency on the Upload page
- Invite all manufacturers to participate.
- Manipulate delay, polarity, level, and coherence blanking of data.
- Crosshairs on the measurement plot.

# In Progress

These are under construction.

- Decode audio file on backend
- Loudspeakers are searchable by Market and Frequency

# Exploring

This is a list of interesting ideas. We haven't committed to them yet, but we're eager to see if they resonate with you.

- Include website metrics
- Include other types of measurements beyond solo on-axis elements: arrays, in-situ, off-axis
- Convolution: listen to your own source material through the speaker using the IR
- Funding: how do we pay for this thing?
- Tighter integration between the forum and discussion on Tracebook so that activity is mirrored.
- Change log for every measurement.
- Export manipulated data.

# Leaving It For Now

These are ideas we explored but decided not to pursue for the time being.

- Input calibration: More than one person has been calibrating their inputs and then attenuating their amplifier levels because it is unclear that the sig gen level can be adjust after calibration.

- Aim: If your VHF has a strange/steep slope up or down, it may not be properly aimed. Compare to manufacturer GLL or Tracebook or put the speaker on a stand and measure from 1m. Carpet may be a problem!

At higher frequencies you have the best chance of accurately measuring a level offset as a function of distance by virtue of keeping the room out of the measurement.

For Latency Finder to work, the level drop must be caused solely by distance, i.e., 1/r law (6 dB‑per‑doubling‑distance)—without any angular attenuation—i.e., attenuation as a function of measurement angle (with respect ot the loudspeaker) rather than distance.

Hi Karl,

Great meeting with you today. I wanted to clear up one part of the measurement procedure that I may have screwed up: microphone placement.

The transfer function mic may be in the near-field, but the max SPL may not.

You will probably need 3 positions:

1. PLAYBACK: Close enough to get > 15dB of SNR–to determine maximum playback level and capture the stop conditions. Page 9 of Tracebook Measurement procedure.

2. TRANSFER FUNCTION: Recommended distance, but as close as necessary to get <6dB of ripple–to measure the transfer function and IR where SNR is >10dB.

3. MAX SPL: Recommended distance–to capture max SPL.

Recommended distance = at least 3x the loudspeaker's baffle diagonal.",0,,,2021-02-10T17:16:41+00,2021-02-10T17:16:41+00
944360731,1974815518,Kara!,829834694,"Thanks to Hui-Yu we have a bunch of new speaker models available in SubAligner including:

- L-Acoustics Kara, Kara II
- EAW LA215, JF8, UB12Si, LA118
- Coda Audio G308-Pro, d&b Y8, and RCF ST 12-SMA

[Here’s a direct link to Kara + SB28.](https://app.subaligner.com/?a=1630504538622x122340097348599800)

I have also completed the entire Meyer Sound inventory, minus the cinema range. At this point, if you are deploying a Meyer Sound system, you have every combination possible including starting points and delay integration.

The new Kara results seem to be in good agreement with the L-Acoustics preset guide.

Here’s Kara_Kara with SB28_100. The difference of 0.57ms is equal to 15º at 100Hz resulting in a maximum deviation of 0.5dB.

![](https://static.peerboard.com/community-file/5612e5ea-ff53-44e9-b1b2-aadedddd9972.png)

If you have experimented with implementing some of the suggestions from the Filter pop-up then may have wondered why the result has less overall summation. That’s because SubAligner is looking for the result best matched to the custom target I have created. The target is based on various manufacturer’s main+sub alignments I have studied.

![](https://static.peerboard.com/community-file/9b9b2b4a-d0e6-4f5c-b4ef-b6ff2dbdad5f.png)

Here’s another comparison of the L-Acoustics Preset Guide with a SubAligner result. It’s still a Kara with an SB28. I just changed the DSP preset to SB_60. The difference of 7.25ms is equal to half a cycle at 70Hz, which would account for the polarity inversion and the seesaw action. In this case I’m happy to see that SubAligner has produce a similar result with less delay.

961223085,308303758,How to verify VHF response,829834694,"One of the most common problems we see with measurements being uploaded to Tracebook is the VHF (very high frequency) response. If you upload a response that has a surprising slope down or up, the moderator is going to seek out a reference for comparison. You can save yourself some time by doing your own verification before measurement and upload.

The most common source of these VHF problems has been vertical aim and reflective surface. First, let's discuss vertical aim.

These easiest way to verify this is to play the game of hot & cold. Watch the magnitude response while you rock the speaker up and down to find the maximum.

![](https://static.peerboard.com/community-file/3a6c0977-7f64-44f0-853e-b24736389490.gif)



![](https://youtu.be/TrkOrQYjPPo)

This is not a guaranteed solution, though. If you still have doubts, please try one of the following methods.

Measure perfectly on-axis with the speaker on a table. Use that trace as an aiming target when you go back to ground plane. For more on this, please see line 250 of [the measurement procedure](https://goesto11.peerboard.com/post/928726115).

![](https://static.peerboard.com/community-file/0f71c225-dd08-4b54-8776-23b414431c4b.png)

Seek out a reference from the manufacturer. This is typically how a moderator is going to grade your measurement. If you look at the speaker's spec sheet or the GLL file and your measurement varies significantly, you can expect a moderator to have questions.

![](https://static.peerboard.com/community-file/3c56ea7d-d72a-4dff-bde9-4feeecf57ed0.png)

The other common problem is the reflective surface. If you have some suspicions that the carpet or stone you are measuring on is causing the problem then start with one of the two verification methods above. A possible solution is discussed on line 461 of the measurement procedure:

Strike...

Part of our industry is based on a marketing‑driven economy where the kind of data—and how it is represented—affect sales. Some manufacturers may decide to publish, e.g., (over)simplified, incomplete, incomparable, or beautified data. As a result, manufacturer interests may lead to data which differs from field measurements that in turn cannot be validated.

Replave with...

Manufacturers publish high quality performance data for the products they create. Since there are many different ways to measure loudspeakers and interpret the data, there exists some ambiguity when comparing data from one manufacturer with that of another. In addition to that, most manufacturers have dedicated facilities (such as anechoic chambers) in which their products are measured. While this approach produces data that is very “clean”, it makes it difficult for the common user to verify the loudspeaker’s performance in the field.",0,,,2021-05-17T15:38:20+00,2021-05-17T15:38:20+00

For the Delay Finder Spreadsheet to work, you must enter the axial levels that correspond with each distance. While Nathan entered the times/distances in the right order, he mixed up the corresponding levels. Easy sanity check: further away must be less loud.

In the attached screenshot you see the correct order which results in an approximate latency of 3 ms. Nathan stated that he measured a physical distance of 1 m. So the approx. latency is overestimated most likely because the level offset was not captured accurately, or the closer measurement was made on-axis while the second measurement was made off-axis.

The spreadsheet works best when inverse-square-law is the only cause for level loss which requires you to avoid angular attenuation, i.e., both measurements shall be made on-axis.

- Alignments page renamed to History. Hopefully this is more clear.
- The calculated alignment values are now visible on the History page. Previously you would need to re-run the speaker combination to get the alignment values. This feature was requested to facilitate comparison. (eg. You aligned at three different positions and want to compare the results.)
- More DSP preset information now available through pop-up.

DRAFT:

Tracebook Introduction and Invitation 

When visiting a venue, would it not be nice to know what to expect from the loudspeakers before the measurement kit was deployed? System techs think so and so do we.

Tracebook has been developed to fill this need. The intention is to provide a platform where  audio professionals can follow a procedure (attached) to measure loudspeakers themselves, upload the data, have it approved by moderators, and made available to other audio professionals - for free. The goal is for users to provide other users with actionable loudspeaker field data to help them in their daily work. 

Following a procedure, users can record measurements of a loudspeaker, including frequency, phase, and impulse response, a wave file, and maximum SPL. The data set must also include a photo of the microphone and loudspeaker, a description of the measurement setup, and all of the equipment settings used during data acquisition. 

Once completed, the user uploads the data and it is reviewed by two moderators. If the data set is found to be within the tolerances laid out in the procedure and does not include any obvious errors, the data set is approved and is published to the site. As additional users submit their own measurements of the same loudspeaker, confidence in the data sets grows. For loudspeaker data available on the site, users can view the data or download it, including files that can be used as reference traces in measurement software.

The measurement procedure describes methods that yield actionable field data. Some users will acquire measurements with a bit of frequency response ripple, for instance, that would be unacceptable in an anechoic laboratory grade measurement, but is perfectly fine for the purposes of Tracebook. If the procedure is well executed, the data correlates well with laboratory grade measurements, but is not intended or suggested to be a replacement of them. 

Tracebook is an independent, public, non-profit online community that promotes the open exchange of loudspeaker data. This site will never be monetized. We want to be the Switzerland of loudspeaker field data, and we have designed the platform to be just that. Safeguards and procedures have been built in to account for bias, human error, and misbehavior. The site is currently wrapping up the private beta testing and will be available for public beta testing in the coming weeks. It’s likely to be a slow-growing community, but we are ready if it becomes popular.

We are writing today so that you are not surprised, discovering this community sometime in the future. We welcome your involvement and participation, but not your dollars. You can join, participate in the forum, upload loudspeaker data, and take a look at other loudspeakers. Because disclosure is important to us, when signing up, please use your work email and list your company affiliation. Please see the attached signup instructions. 

Welcome to the Switzerland of loudspeaker data!

Thank you,

The Tracebook Volunteers

The results agree well with those in the RCF Pre-alignment Delays Guide. The result from SubAligner gives a bit more weight to the alignment in the lower end of the crossover region, accounting for the approximately 30º offset visible in the higher end of the crossover region.

1464745727,401419744,Very Important Data Point,682517670,"Fellow moderators,

Here's a very important data point in the interest of developing the measurement procedure in a pragmatic way. User Michael Hack made a measurement of a Meyer Sound LEOPARD at 1-meter distance which can be compared directly to data from MAPP measured in an anechoic chamber.

These traces—from 63 Hz and up—match each other sufficienly enough and the standard deviation is just below 2 dB.

In this example, 1-meter is roughly 1.5 times the baffle diagonal (mirror image excluded).

The phase trace at higher frequencies differs only because the delay locater was off by a sample or so.

Thoughts?

I could only get it to work by attaching a shiny plate to the speaker face.

This is fine for speakers that I can reach, but what about arrays high up in the air? Is there a better strategy to measure distance in the sun? Do I need to upgrade to some kind of range finder?

1500469945,25721842,Distance measurement tips in sunlight,829834694,"What are some of your distance measurement tips for outdoors + sunlight?

1. Get closer. If you calculate your alignment position with Merlijn’s Sub Align calculator, you will often find that the best alignment position is a lot closer than you thought. This will make a distance measurement a lot easier to do.
2. 3D design. If you can get the distances from a 3D model ahead of time, that’s the best.
3. Target. Many laser distos come with a little mirror that you can attach to the speaker. Anything reflective will work.
4. Camera. My laser disto has a camera on it. This makes it much easier to aim. You still need something shiny to aim at, though, and for longer distances you’ll need a tripod for accurate aim since your hands will never be still enough.
5. Right triangle solver. If you can’t get a lock on the speaker, you can put the disto on the ground and aim at a target on the ground below the speaker.  Then measure the height of the speaker. This feature is not built into SubAligner.
6. Range finder. I keep a golf range finder as a back-up. It’s only accurate to within 1m, but it’s better than nothing and can be used to verify questionable laser disto readings.

Firstly would you still include each individual subwoofer in the total box count field? Secondly, in terms of total output delay. Would you then add this final delay to each subwoofer independantly? 



Let's assume a 4 element end fire array spaced 1m apart. Could you explain the process here? Could also explain the process for a 6 element gradient array where two subwoofers are physically reversed and then polarity inverted.

1703484976,25721842,Why doesn't a laser work?,829834694,"ADAM: My understanding is that SubAligner works better for crossover alignment than simply measuring the distance offset with a laser disto because SubAligner takes the entire crossover region into account instead of just a single frequency.

NATHAN: Not exactly. If you take a look at the Pre-alignment delay values section of the L-Acoustics Preset Guide, you'll see that you need both the geometric distance offset AND the pre-alignment values. SubAligner works the same way. It finds a pre-alignment that works, then adds the geometric distance offset from your inputs. So it's not so much about what frequency or range of frequencies are used, but combining both the geometric offset and the speaker's native offset. Few speaker combinations are aligned when equidistant so you almost always need the pre-alignment values. Otherwise you're rolling the dice.

ADAM: Right. I think that is the case with Leopard and 900LFC.

NATHAN: What happens when you open that combination in SubAliger?

ADAM: 0.59ms.

NATHAN: Bingo.

Two things: 

1) The graph of the measurement isn't showing up in either Chrome or Safari for me.

2) I can't import the CSV for the EON or the NEXO into Smaart, most of the data is missing, and there are asterisks in place of where the numbers should be for Magnitude, Phase & Coherence in the text file (perhaps this is also the reason for issue #1) Probably a failed export on the part of Steve.

----Edit----

OK, the asterisks are caused by the coherence blanking settings in Smaart, anything below the blanking doesn't get written to the text file as data, but as asterisks.  As a note - It should be mentioned in A.6 in the guideliens to set coherence blanking to ""zero"" before doing an ASCII export, when that section gets written.

The CSV import issue was my fault, I wasn't thinking about Smaart requiring tab separated, not comma separated ASCII. Doh!! 

Also, I accidentally posted this as a comment to your original posting, which I thought was an ""admin only"" thread because of the ""admin"" logo at the top. Hmmm......

The reason that you get different results with different DSP settings in SubAligner is that the DSP settings affect the magnitude and phase response. If you change a filter from 80 to a 100 Hz, the phase will shift, and you're going to need different settings for the alignment.

Feel free to download those traces from SubAligner and come up with your own custom presets. One easy way to get started is to use the SubAligner alignment recommendation and then try apply symmetrical filters.

- Any reason to work in max SPL to my workshop? Does it make sense to perform a max SPL test on your speakers once a year to make sure they are still performing to spec?

- Since it can be difficult to capture HF outdoors, would it be acceptable to create an average from several measurements?",0,,,2022-06-27T22:19:36+00,2022-06-27T22:19:36+00

2127215490,308303758,FAQ - September 2021,829834694,"Over the last few months I've been responding to a lot of questions about Tracebook and I'd like to share some of the most common here today.

Everything that I'm going to cover is contained in the [Tracebook Measurement Procedure](https://goesto11.peerboard.com/post/928726115) and our [Getting Started video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsfnoBcHUm222UrwdC6zXS2cA-KQCcOQ1).

Before I get started I want to give a big shout out and thank you to everyone who has been taking measurements for Tracebook and especially [Hui-Yu Huang](https://trace-book.org/profile/hui-yu-huang) who has been working with me diligently to solve various issues.

- Input calibration: Fresh battery in the mic calibrator. Use all of our recommended settings. Output levels must match. If reference branch input level is still too high adjust output sensitivity or use a different reference level. Signal generator level may be adjust from within your audio analyzer afterwards because that won't affect the unity state.
- Amp gain: Amplifier levels need to be documented. We realize that if a system is overpowered that you might want to decrease amplifier gain to improve SNR.
- Aim: If your VHF has a strange/steep slope up or down that deviates significantly from manufacturer documentation there may be an issue. Compare your measurement to manufacturer documentation, another Tracebook upload, or put the speaker on a stand and measure from 1m. Carpet may be a problem!
- Smaart export: Disable coherence blanking and smoothing.

2128027077,25721842,What to do when you can't hear the results?,829834694,"I've been struggling to figure out what to tell people when SubAligner obviously works at ground-plane, but seems to fail at head-height.

Here's what I'm thinking:

If you can’t hear the improvement

	1.	Did you enter the distances and distance unit correct? (very common!)

	2.	Did you enter the output settings correct in your DSP?

	3.	Did you accidentally leave any filters in the signal chain or anything else that could cause phase shift?

## Listening

Sub alignment inside is hard! Reflections are guaranteed to screw things up. I have some tips, but unless you can clearly validate a better alignment with your audio analyzer, I still recommend using the SubAligner results. At the end of the day, aligning to direct sound will provide a better global alignment for your audience.

If you can’t hear an improvement at your FOH position then it is likely overwhelmed with reflections. Try moving your alignment/listening position to 3/4 depth and at least 3m away from any walls.

If your listening depth is within 1/5 of the speaker height, you may mislead by a floor bounce. You can try moving deeper or even listening at ground plane, but I recommend walking the room in an attempt to compare result in aggregate.

If a reflection is ruining your FOH alignment, DO NOT ALIGN TO THE REFLECTION. The reflection will likely be attenuated by the audience and will become insignificant at five times the speaker height.",0,,,2021-03-11T01:02:38+00,2021-03-11T01:02:38+00
